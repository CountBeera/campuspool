#Campus Pool: Connecting Students for Sustainable Campus Transportation
Commuting can be a significant challenge for college students, whether they are day scholars or hostellers. Existing transportation options like personal vehicles, public transit, or ride-hailing services often come with inconveniences, high costs, or environmental concerns. **That’s where Campus Pool comes in.**

##Project Overview
Campus Pool aims to revolutionize campus transportation by connecting students who need rides with those offering them. Our app provides a reliable alternative for day scholars who miss buses or prefer traveling together. Hostellers can easily coordinate rides for outings, airport transfers, or railway station drop-offs. By encouraging ride-sharing, our app promotes a sense of community, facilitates social connections, and reduces the campus’s carbon footprint.

##Key Features
**Ride Creation**: Students can create ride requests, specifying their origin, destination, and preferred time.
**Ride Joining**: Other students can join existing rides based on their schedules and preferences.
**In-App Chat**: Communicate with fellow riders to coordinate details or ask questions.
**Bill Splitting**: Easily divide ride costs among participants.

##How It Works
**User Profiles**: Students create profiles with their details, including their status as day scholars or hostellers.
**Ride Requests**: Day scholars can request rides, and hostellers can offer rides.
**Matching Algorithms**: Our robust algorithms match riders and drivers based on schedules, locations, and preferences.
**Convenient Communication**: In-app chat allows users to discuss ride details and coordinate effectively.
**Safety First**: We prioritize safety by verifying user profiles and providing essential safety guidelines.

##Benefits
###For Day Scholars:
Reliable alternative when public transit or shuttle services are unavailable or inconvenient.
Opportunity to travel with fellow students and build connections.
###For Hostellers:
Easily find rides for weekend outings, airport transfers, or railway station drop-offs.
Contribute to a greener campus by sharing rides.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
